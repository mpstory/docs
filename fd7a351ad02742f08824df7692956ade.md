# ✨ Draggable Split View Flow:
- Default state:
	- Top half: Map (showing pins, your spots, tours)
	- Bottom half: Search bar + list (spots, tours, filters)
- User can drag the divider up or down:
	- Drag up → Full map (immersive exploring mode)
	- Drag down → Full list (search-focused mode)
- Smooth transition with friction, maybe slight animation bounce when reaching limits.
- When typing in search:
	- Optionally auto-collapse map a little to prioritize results.
	- But you still let user drag back up easily.

among search results can be labels too! And plus button has to have 2 options for a user to create: a spot and a label

## 📚 Updated Search/List Area
Search results can now include:

- Spots (places you saved)
- Tours (collections of spots)
- Labels/Tags (categories you've created)
We could add little icons next to each type for clarity:
- 📍 Spot
- 🛤️ Tour
- 🏷️ Label
- Maybe even let you filter by type if you want ("show only labels" etc).

## ➕ Updated Add Button Behavior
When you tap the big "+" button:
- Show a small pop-up menu (bottom sheet or radial menu):
	- ➕ Add Spot
	- 🏷️ Create Label

You could make this super fast:
single tap = "Add Spot" (most common action)
long press = opens the full menu (Spot or Label)
